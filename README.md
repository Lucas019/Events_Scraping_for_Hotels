# Events Scraping for Chain Hotels
This is a final project for the Data Design and Representation Class, I leveraged ticketmaster public APIs and eventbrite website to scrape useful events for chain hotels such as  Ace Hotel. Then I store the events in two separate MongoDB database, one for ticketmaster and one for eventbrite.
